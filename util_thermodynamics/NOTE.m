Units:
	SI (temperature in K).

Notations:
	r,rl,ri,rt: mixing ratio of water (vapor,liquid,ice,total).
	q,ql,qi,qt: specific humidity/liquid/ice/total water content.

- The following are functions defined by formulae:
	Tv: virtual temperature (or density temperature).
    
	es: saturation vapor pressure with respect to liquid water.
	es_bolton: es from Bolton (1980).
	esi: saturation vapor pressure over ice.

	qs: saturation specific humidity with respect to liquid water.
	qsi: saturation specific humidity over ice.
    
	theta_v: virtual potential temperature.
	theta_e: equivalent potential temperature.
	theta_l: liquid water potential temperature.
	theta_il: ice-liquid potential temperature.
